I would ALSO expect an easy to use search bar, with an advanced filter button. Diet,

WHEN i click on the advanced search button i EXPECT to find checkboxes to help filter my recipes.

as I SCROLL to the bottom of the index page, i WOULD like to have random recipes displayed for 'inspiration'. IF i click on this recipe, i EXPECT to be taken to this recipe.

When I SEARCH a recipe.

I should be REDIRECTED to the menus page, Where I expect to SEE recipe cards related to my search.

IF i missed the option to filter on the index, i WOULD like to have the option on the recipes incase i change my mind.

I WOULD like my first glance at the recipes to give me:

- a image of the dish

i WOULD also like the option to QUICK save the recipes without having to relocate to a different page, so i can ADD MULTIPLE recipes in one go.
